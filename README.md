SoA
=====

Vector types, but instead of being represented as Array-Of-Struct, data is stored
as a Struct-Of-Arrays, or SoA.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cgaebel/soa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cgaebel/soa)

A large subset of the `std::Vec` interface is supported, as well as some extras
to make writing efficient code more natural.
